# Jewelry Catalog Repository

This repository contains the code for **Jewelry Catalog**, my first project, which started as a prototype. Itâ€™s a simple application designed to showcase a catalog of jewelry items and enable user interactions with sellers.

## Project Overview
- **Features**:
  - Browse a catalog of jewelry items such as necklaces, bangles, rings, and more.
  - Add items to a **wishlist**.
  - Share the wishlist with a seller to discuss pricing and address quality concerns.
- **Purpose**: To streamline communication between customers and sellers while providing an organized catalog for easy browsing.

## Technology Stack
- Built using a basic stack to focus on functionality and user experience.

## Future Plans
- Add a **shopping cart** for purchase tracking.
- Enhance the design with more interactive elements and animations.
- Improve the user experience with better navigation and advanced features.

This project showcases my skills in building functional prototypes and lays the foundation for more sophisticated features in the future.
